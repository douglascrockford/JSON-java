Bugs
[ 1 ]	if I create an JSONObject from a JSON file, and this file has some
	string values like {"key" : "value"} then if one value containes
	':' character, it seems that the second part after this character
	will be ignored.
	Example: {"key" : "value:2"} --write_to_JSONObject"--> {"key":"value"}
